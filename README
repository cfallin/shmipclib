shmipclib is a very simple shared-memory IPC wrapper that provides very fast
userspace message passing over shared memory segments, synchronized only by
spinlocks. This allows two or more processes (or threads) to communicate
without going through the kernel when they run simultaneously on two different
cores.

To use shmipclib, simply:

1. Include shm.h in your application.

2. Add "-lrt" to your linker (library) options.

shmipclib should work on x86-64 Linux.
